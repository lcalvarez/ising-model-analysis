# ising-model-analysis
This repository contains the python code to run and analyze Ising model
thermodynamic systems using monte carlo methods. 

# ising_nd.py
This program simulates the Ising Model of ferromagnetism
in multiple dimensions using the Metropolis update algorithm
and the Wolff Clustering algorithm. Programming is optimized
to input variables of interest and output observables.

# analyze_ising_data.py
This program reads in data files that have been generated
by Ising_ND.py. Once read, the data is analyzed, 
observables are extracted, the critical temperature,
and correlation length with critical exponent nu is 
displayed. 

# data_dir
This sub-directory contains all the data created by the
ising model simulations.
